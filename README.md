# 🚀 Automated Deployment of Node.js Application with Terraform and Ansible

## 📋 Project Overview
This project automates the deployment of a Node.js application by setting up AWS infrastructure using Terraform and configuring Nginx with Ansible. It creates a secure and scalable environment by provisioning VPC, EC2 instances, and security groups, and ensures the Node.js app is served through an Nginx reverse proxy.

---

## 🧰 Features
- 🌐 **VPC & Networking:** Automated setup of VPC, subnets, and routing.
- 💻 **EC2 Instances:** Creation of 3 EC2 instances using Terraform.
- 🔒 **Security Groups:** Configured security groups for secure access.
- 🛠️ **Nginx Reverse Proxy:** Ansible automation to configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for the Node.js app.
- 🚀 **Node.js Application Deployment:** Automates deployment and server setup.
